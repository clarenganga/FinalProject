Sentiment Analyzer - Final Project

This sentiment analyzer is a Python program that predicts the sentiment of text using machine learning techniques. It uses a dataset of labeled text to train a Naive Bayes classifier, which is then used to predict the sentiment of new text.

Requirements

Python 3
scikit-learn library
pandas library
Installation

Install Python 3 from the official website.
Install scikit-learn and pandas libraries using pip. Open the terminal and type the following commands:
      pip install scikit-learn
      pip install pandas
Download the sentiment analyzer program from the GitHub repository.

Usage

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the sentiment analyzer program.
Run the program by typing the following command:
      python sentiment_analyzer.py

Follow the prompts to enter the input text and see the predicted sentiment.

Dataset
The dataset used to train the Naive Bayes classifier is the "sentiment_data" dataset, which can be found at the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12vGjEpBfKEkpEiqsmVl81PWFOVQiZ7__/view?usp=share_link
